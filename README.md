# SwiftCart

SwiftCart is a modern e-commerce website that was initially built in ReactJS and I built it with Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS. 

# Introduction

SwiftCart is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience with a focus on simplicity and performance. The website intergrates with the **Fake Store API** to display a variety of products, allowing users to filter and sort through items easily. 

# Technologies used

* Alpine.js: A lightweight JavaScript framework for interactivity.
* Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framwork for creating responsive designs.
* Fake Store API: https://fakestoreapi.com/ A public API that provides product data for e-commerce websites.

# Setup Instructions 

1. Clone repository
2. Ensure you have '*npm*' and '*node.js*' installed. Then run: *npm install*
3. Start a local server to see the website

# Usage

1. Navigate to the website
2. *Filter Products*: Click on the "All Categories" dropdown to filter products by category. Only the selected category will be visible, and others will disappear from the options.
3. *Search Products:* Use the search input to find products by their titles
4. *Sort Products*: Use the sort dropdown to sort products by price, either low to high or high to low. And you can sort them back to their default setting.
